Below you can find all of the information you need about Poynings Cricket Club fees as a member of the club.

Poynings Cricket Club prides itself on being an inclusive club, welcoming players of all ages and abilities. We aim to keep our fees as low as possible to ensure that cricket is accessible to everyone.

We think that our fees are very reasonable, especially when you consider the cost of playing cricket at other clubs in the county. We also offer flexible payment options to help spread the cost of memberships and fees.

Finally we offer discounts for junior members, or those still in full-time education, to ensure that cricket is accessible to these individuals (excluding those who are in employment alongside their studies, e.g. university students).

> All fees are collected digitally through [Spond](https://www.spond.com/), our club management app. If you are not already a member of Spond, please contact us to be added to the club group. Cash is no longer accepted.
